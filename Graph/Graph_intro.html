<!-- Graph is a non linear data structure type and it is more complex from other data structures -->

<!-- If our data structure follows any sequence then it is a linear data structure.
If our data structure not following any sequence then it is a non-linear data structure. -->

<!-- In graph, the data is present in the form of nodes or we can also called them as vertices and each node will connect with eachother with the edges -->

<!-- There are two types of graphs -->
<!--
1. Directed Graph -- Their direction will already present that how you can traverse the graph ; A - B - D - C
2. Undirected Graph -- In this, direction will not given so we traverse in any way but must be the node or vertices connected with other node like A - B ; B - c ; C - A ; B - D etc. 
-->

<!-- Disconnnected Graph -- Means there is a node which is not connected to the rest of the graph nodes -->

<!-- Bi-Dierctional Graph -- In the graph, node will move from like as A to B or B to A;   -->

<!-- Self Loop Graph -- The node through which we can go to their own self -->

<!-- Null Graph -- In which there is no data in the nodes -->

<!-- The Most asking graph is Directed and Undirected graph -->


<!-- USE OF GRAPH :- -->
<!--
1. In google map ; there is a map where the graph data structure is mainly used.
2. In social media, the graph is used as you have seen that your friend of friend post also in your feed sometimes.
